## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my Github profile, feel free to take a look around my projects.

## Highlights

### AI Story Generator

A project that makes use of AI to build a story using basic story building prompts. If you need inspiration most of the prompts can be filled out using AI also.

Usage requires your own Google AI Studio API key.
